# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.1.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- **Window Collapse Support**: Removed `ImGuiWindowFlags.NoCollapse` from the Configuration window flags to enable native title bar collapse buttons.

---

## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Round Number Close Message**: Fixed the round close chat announcement message to use the correct round number (queries the index before marking the round inactive).

---

## [0.0.0.11] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Concatenated Server Name Stripping**: Added detection of direct suffix concatenation (e.g. `Hisui AsadaLich` or `Xerina NightfangCerberus`) by checking the end of the name against a compiled list of all FFXIV world servers, stripping it dynamically for UI rendering and chat announcements while preserving the backend database key structure.

---

## [0.0.0.10] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Server Name Suffix Stripping**: Expanded server suffix cleaning to handle cross-world players whose names appear with different suffixes in chat logs and player lists (supporting `@`, `¤`, `(`, `[`, and `<` format splits).
- **Database Migration**: Added automated startup migration to clean any legacy player names and turn history records already stored with server suffixes in the user config file.
- **Turns Tab Vicinity Clean**: Cleaned server name suffixes from vicinity lists in the Turns tab to ensure matches align correctly with database stats.

---

## [0.0.0.9] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Exclude Consecutive Players from Dice Announcement**: Added a configuration setting under the Balancing Mode tab to prevent players who just had a turn (last round's Giver and Receiver) from being chosen in the automatic standard Dice Announcement. It will pick the next highest/lowest rolls instead, falling back gracefully if not enough clean players are present.

---

## [0.0.0.8] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Announcement Placeholders**: Added `[GiverRoll]` and `[ReceiverRoll]` (or `[CustomGiverRoll]` / `[CustomReceiverRoll]`) placeholders in both standard and custom selected announcement messages to dynamically output the dice roll numbers of the players.
- **Avoid Consecutive Turns**: Added a configuration setting `"Avoid Consecutive Turns"` under the Balancing Mode tab to automatically filter out players who just had a turn (giver and receiver of the previous round) from being recommended in the current round, and highlight them with a `(Just played)` suffix and gold color in both the selection dropdowns and the **Players & Rolls** tracking list.

### Fixed
- **Local Player Announcement**: Always use the full local player name instead of `"You"` when the hoster wins or loses a roll.
- **Server Name Visibility**: Hidden/stripped server suffixes (e.g. `@ServerName`) from player names in announcements and vicinity lists.

---

## [0.0.0.5] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Support & Community Tab**: Added a dedicated Support & Community tab in the configuration window featuring direct "Join Support Discord" and "Support on Ko-fi" buttons.
- **Local Dev Icon Packaging**: Configured project build settings to automatically copy `icon.png` to local output directories (`bin/x64/Debug` and `bin/x64/Release`).

---

## [0.0.0.4] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Turns Mode Tab**: Added a new manual "taking turns" mode log layout.
  - Left-to-right flow with list style display.
  - Dynamically stretches vertically to utilize all available layout height.
  - Support for custom manual turns logging with vicinity player list dropdowns.
  - Verification that default log choices are labeled as Truths if separate tracking is disabled.
- **ToD Database Tab**: Moved the Truth & Dare inspiration database manager out of the Settings menu and placed it next to the Balancing tab for fast CRUD and roll operations.
- **Dice Mode Integration**: Configured automated dice roll announcements to automatically register in the Turn Log.
- **Round Count Integration**: Every recorded turn now increments the `RoundsParticipated` metric for all players in the game (and decrements it upon undo), keeping stats fully synchronized.
- **Next-Turn Highlight**: The name of the receiver in the latest turn log entry is highlighted with a bright gold/yellow color, providing a clear indicator of who asks next.
- **Taller UI Elements**: Vertical heights for **Record Turn** and **Undo Last Turn** buttons increased to `35f`.

### Fixed
- **Right-Click Edit & Removal Modals**: Fixed an issue where right-clicking turn entries or player names did not open the edit and delete confirmation popup modals due to ImGui ID stack nested scoping issues. Popups now open reliably at the tab's root ID stack level.
- **vicinity Dropdown Stability**: Comboboxes for selecting Givers and Receivers now bind to stable string name references instead of array indexes to prevent choice fluctuation when vicinity players move out of range.
- **Separated Tracking Visibility**: Truth/Dare selectors and indicators are now dynamically hidden when "Separate Truth/Dare Tracking" is disabled.
